# Fatigue-life-of-Titanium-Alloy-Composites
This project is about prediction of fatigue life of ceramic reinforced titanium alloy composites using machine learning algorithms - random forest and xgboost. These algorithm predicts fatigue life of varing ceramic percentage and other fators.Fatigue life prediction of titanium alloy composites using machine learning helps estimate how long the material can withstand repeated stress. Algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost analyze stress levels, temperature, and material properties to find patterns. These models improve accuracy compared to traditional testing methods and save time. Engineers use these predictions to design safer and more durable components. This approach enhances material reliability in aerospace, automotive, and biomedical applications.
